## 360째 videos

The video material used in our benchmark consists of the following 360째 videos that we filmed using an [Insta Pro 2 camera](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-pro2).

| Name      | Duration (s) | Download Links |
|:----------|:------------:|:-----|
| Fireplace | 227          | [Unstitched](TODO) <br> [Stitched Monoscopic (2D)](TODO) <br> [Stitched Stereoscopic (3D)](TODO) |
| Suburb    | 245          | [Unstitched](TODO) <br> [Stitched Monoscopic (2D)](TODO) <br> [Stitched Stereoscopic (3D)](TODO) |

For the benchmark, we stitched the 360째 videos in equirectangular projection using the [Insta360 Stitcher 3.1.3 software](https://www.mantis-sub.com/support/) and the following parameters.

| Parameter                   | Value                            |
|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------:|
| Content Type                | Monoscopic                       |

| Use nadir logo              | Disabled                         |
| Resolution                  | 8K (7680 $\times$ 3840 pixels) |
| Output Format               | MP4                              |
| Codec Type                  | H265 codec                       |
| Bitrate                     | 144 Mibps*                       |
| Frame Rate                  | 29.97                            |
| Audio Type                  | None                             |

\* Even though Insta360 Stitcher shows the bitrate in Mbps, Mibps are used during encoding.
A bitrate of 144 Mibps is approximately 151 Mbps.

## Tiles

The 360째 videos were cut into 6 by 6 tiles (from left to right, then top to bottom) using the following FFmpeg command.

```bash
ffmpeg -y -hide_banner -i video.mp4 -vf "crop=1280:640:0:0" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile1.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:1280:0" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile2.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:2560:0" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile3.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:3840:0" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile4.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:5120:0" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile5.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:6400:0" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile6.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:0:640" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile7.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:1280:640" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile8.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:2560:640" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile9.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:3840:640" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile10.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:5120:640" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile11.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:6400:640" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile12.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:0:1280" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile13.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:1280:1280" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile14.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:2560:1280" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile15.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:3840:1280" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile16.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:5120:1280" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile17.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:6400:1280" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile18.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:0:1920" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile19.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:1280:1920" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile20.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:2560:1920" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile21.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:3840:1920" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile22.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:5120:1920" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile23.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:6400:1920" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile24.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:0:2560" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile25.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:1280:2560" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile26.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:2560:2560" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile27.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:3840:2560" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile28.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:5120:2560" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile29.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:6400:2560" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile30.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:0:3200" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile31.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:1280:3200" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile32.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:2560:3200" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile33.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:3840:3200" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile34.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:5120:3200" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile35.y4m -vf "crop=1280:640:6400:3200" -pix_fmt yuv420p tile36.y4m
